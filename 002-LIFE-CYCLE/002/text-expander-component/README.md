🚀🌌 Space Travel: Exploring the Cosmos with React! 🌌🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I recently delved into some React exercise and created this cool component that I thought I'd share with you all!

🔍 Check out this TextExpander component I built in React! It's a neat little tool that allows you to expand and collapse text, perfect for those lengthy passages or articles. Plus, it's customizable! You can set the number of words to display when collapsed, change button text, and even the button color!

👩‍💻 Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:
1️⃣ Displays text with a default number of words and provides a button to expand and collapse the text.
2️⃣ You can customize the number of words to display when collapsed, the text on the expand/collapse button, and even the button color!
3️⃣ Perfect for showcasing lengthy content while maintaining a clean and organized UI.

Space travel is the ultimate adventure, and with this little React exercise, I felt like I was exploring new worlds myself! 🌠 Feel free to check out the code and try it yourself!
