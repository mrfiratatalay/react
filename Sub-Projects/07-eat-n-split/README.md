🚀 I want to share exciting news! 🌟

I've developed a brand new project called Eat-'N-Split, where I reinforced our fundamental knowledge of React. In this project, I improved myself by practically using core concepts like state, props, and events. Now, I'd like to share this experience with you.

🍽️ What is Eat-'N-Split? It's an application that allows you to easily split the bill when dining with friends. 🍽️💸

📌 Key Features:

Add your friends to the list and assign them a random avatar. Select the friend you want to split the bill with. Enter the total expenses and your individual spending. The application calculates who owes how much by evenly splitting the bill.

I'm delighted to share this experience with you at this stage of my React learning journey. I would greatly appreciate it if you could review my project and share your feedback. Have a great day! 🌟
