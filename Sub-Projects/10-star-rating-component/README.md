🌟📊 New React Exercise: Star Rating Component 📊🌟

Hello LinkedIn Fam! Today, I'd like to share with you the latest React exercise I've been working on. This time, I've created a star rating component and I'm excited to show you how I did it.

🚀 This component provides a star rating system that can be used in web applications. Some of its features include:
✅ Adjustable maximum rating count
✅ Default rating and size options
✅ Customization options for color and size
✅ Relevant feedback messages

🔗 You can check out the source code on my GitHub for more details.

📽️ Additionally, I've added a short video demonstrating how the component works:
Hope you like it! Looking forward to your comments and feedback. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
